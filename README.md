# Library
This is a program that displays a library. It reads in an Excel file to intialize a GUI of blocks that represent books. Each book carries information such as its title, author, and position on the shelf. There are methods to check out and return books, and they can be sorted and searched by title and author. 

It implements Apache POI, a Java API for Microsoft documents. The code for the API can be found at poi.apache.org.
